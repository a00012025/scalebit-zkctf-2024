# ZK  CFT - Halo2 - Kid's Math

## Overview
1. This is a quiz about Halo2 usage. The standard answer would not be given to participants
2. Instead, a file would be given, with all necessary structs and missing logics. Participants are required to fill in the blanks, compile the program and run tests
3. Multiple test cases would be given, the prover program shall be tested against them

## Problem description
After a hard time on the CTF, you finally find something that seemed very simple to solve. It requires you to forge the proof that you know the value of the term "x": "[1,2,3,5,x]" using the halo2 proof system. Unfortunately, when you write down your answer, you find your proof just can't be verified! Would you try again with incomplete source code, and see how to break through the verifier?

## Comand
cargo test

## Test and Solve
You may only test your circuit by upload the fib.rs
